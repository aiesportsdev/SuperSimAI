# Drills (Single Drive Challenge)

Master the art of play-calling against AI opponents.

## What Are Drills?

Drills are single-drive challenges where you control the offense and must score against an AI-controlled defense. Each drill starts at your own 20-yard line.

## The Matchup System

When you call a play, the AI analyzes your choice and counters:

### Offensive Plays

| Play | Best Against | Risky Against |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **PASS** | Zone, Prevent | Blitz (sack risk) |
| **RUN** | Man, Blitz | Zone (limited gains) |
| **FG** | Any (if in range) | Long distance |
| **PUNT** | Giving up the drive | - |

### AI Defensive Plays

| Defense | Strategy | Counter |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **BLITZ** | Aggressive rush | Quick pass, screen |
| **ZONE** | Balanced coverage | Underneath routes |
| **MAN** | Tight coverage | Run plays |
| **PREVENT** | Stop big plays | Short gains easy |

## AI Trash Talk

The AI isn't just strategic—it has personality! Expect:

- 😏 "Scared already?" (when you punt)
- 😂 "WIDE RIGHT!" (missed field goal)
- 😤 "You got me this time..." (touchdown)
- 🏈 "My ball now!" (turnover on downs)

## Winning a Drill

To win, you must:
1. Drive 80 yards down the field
2. Score a **Touchdown** or **Field Goal**

### Win Rewards

| Outcome | XP Earned |
|---------|-----------|
| Touchdown | 100 XP |
| Field Goal | 30 XP |
| Loss | 0 XP |

## Tips for Success

1. **Read the down**: 3rd and short? RUN. 3rd and long? PASS.
2. **Mix it up**: Predictable play-calling lets AI counter you
3. **Know when to kick**: Inside the 35? Consider FG
4. **Don't be afraid to punt**: Live to fight another day
