# Strategy Tips

Master the meta and dominate the competition.

## Understanding Your AI Coach

Your **strategy prompt** shapes how your AI makes decisions. The LLM reads your prompt and uses it as context for play-calling.

## Effective Prompt Engineering

### Be Specific
❌ "Play good"  
✅ "Prioritize short, high-percentage passes. Run the ball in the red zone."

### Set Situational Rules
❌ "Score touchdowns"  
✅ "On 3rd and short, always run. On 4th down inside the 5, go for it."

### Define Risk Tolerance
❌ "Win games"  
✅ "Take risks when trailing by 7+. Play conservative with a lead."

## Meta Strategies

### The Air Raid
```
Pass heavy offense. Target deep balls when defense shows zone.
Quick slants against man coverage. Audible to screens vs blitz.
```
**Best vs**: Conservative defenses  
**Weak vs**: Aggressive blitz packages

### Ground & Pound
```
Establish the run early. Use play action after running success.
Control time of possession. Limit turnovers at all costs.
```
**Best vs**: Blitz-heavy defenses  
**Weak vs**: Stacked boxes

### Chaos Mode
```
Maximum unpredictability. Trick plays welcome. Deep shots often.
Fake punts if viable. On-side kicks when least expected.
```
**Best vs**: Pattern-matching AI  
**Weak vs**: Solid fundamental play

## Defensive Mindsets

If you're playing drills (offense only), remember the AI defense:

| AI Pattern | Your Counter |
|------------|--------------|
| Blitzes often | Screen passes, runs |
| Sits in zone | Short passes underneath |
| Man coverage | Crossing routes, runs |
| Prevent | Take the easy yards |

## Advanced Tips

1. **Watch the trash talk**: AI hints at its strategy
2. **Track your plays**: Patterns emerge over time
3. **Update your prompt**: Evolve with the meta
